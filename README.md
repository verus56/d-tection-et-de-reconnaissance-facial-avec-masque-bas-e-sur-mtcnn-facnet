This is a quick guide of how to get set up and running a robust real-time facial recognition system using the Pretraiend Facenet Model and MTCNN.
This is a project to detect face mask using MTCNN + OPENCV + EFFICIENTNETB3 from LIVE WEBCAM and detect vacin person 
1. Make a directory of your name inside the Faces folder and upload your 2-3 pictures of you.
2. Run ``` train_v2.py```.
3. Then run ```detect.py``` for realtime face recognization.
3. Then run ```detectmask.py``` for face mask

This code was working properly on tensroflow 2.3.0.
